## This function inputs observed incidence (numbers of cases, deaths, hospitalizations, etc. per day), and uses an adaptation of  Richardson-Lucy deconvolution to recover the underlying incidence curve. 

## ------- Inputs
##  This function follows methods in Goldstein et al. (https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/106/51/21825.full.pdf)
#' @param observed - a vector of the number of observed cases, deaths, hospitalizations, etc. per day
#' @param times - a numeric vector of times corresponding to the entries in observed. Must be the same length as observed.
#' @param p_delay - a numeric vector whose entries give the probability that the delay from infection to observation is exactly 0, 1, ... N days. p_delay must sum to 1 and to to facilitate vectorization should be the same length as observed, and times (the last several entries will most likely be 0s).
#' @param max_iter - maximum number of times to iterate. Following Goldstien et al., the algorithm continues to run until the normalized chi2 statistic comparing the observed and expected number of deaths per day falls below 1, or until the maximum number of iterations is reached.
#' @param out_col_name - string giving the name of the column in which to output the imputed times of infection
## --------- Outputs
#' @value - the function returns a data frame with columns time and out_col_name (which gives the imputed number of infections per timestep)

#   complete(time = 0:max(time)) %>%
